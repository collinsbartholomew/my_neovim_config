# Python Development Environment Enhancements

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Python development environment in Neovim.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Linting Enhancements
- Changed default Python linter from `flake8` to `ruff` in [lint.lua](../../tools/lint.lua)
- Ruff is significantly faster and more feature-rich than flake8
- Better integration with modern Python features

### 2. Formatting Enhancements
- Updated formatter configuration in [conform.lua](../../tools/conform.lua) to use both `ruff` and `black`
- This provides more comprehensive formatting capabilities
- Ruff handles both linting and formatting, providing consistency

### 3. Auto-command Improvements
- Enhanced [autocmds.lua](../../core/autocmds.lua) with dedicated Python linting on save
- Ensured Python files are properly formatted on save
- Added specific Python file type settings

### 4. LSP Configuration
- Enhanced pyright configuration in [lsp.lua](lsp.lua) with additional analysis settings:
  - Function parenthesis completion
  - Improved auto-import capabilities
  - Better diagnostic severity overrides

### 5. Debug Configuration
- Added FastAPI debugging configuration in [debug.lua](debug.lua)
- Enhanced virtual environment detection for all debug configurations

### 6. UI Enhancements
- Created enhanced UI configuration in [python-ui.lua](../../ui/python-ui.lua):
  - PEP 8 compliant color column (79 characters)
  - Better code folding based on indentation

### 7. Additional Tools
- Added new Python commands in [tools.lua](tools.lua):
  - `PythonAudit` - Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
  - `PythonDeps` - Visualize dependency tree
- Updated keymaps in [mappings.lua](mappings.lua) for new commands:
  - `<leader>pya` - Audit dependencies
  - `<leader>pyd` - Show dependencies

## Key Features

### LSP Integration
- Advanced code completion with pyright
- Type checking and diagnostics
- Auto-import functionality
- Refactoring support

### Debugging
- Comprehensive debugging with debugpy
- Support for multiple frameworks (Flask, Django, FastAPI)
- Virtual environment awareness
- Test debugging capabilities

### Formatting & Linting
- Auto-formatting with ruff and black
- Real-time linting with ruff
- PEP 8 compliance checking

### Testing
- Integration with pytest through neotest
- Coverage reporting
- Test debugging

### Security & Dependency Management
- Bandit integration for security scanning
- pip-audit for vulnerability checking
- Dependency visualization

## Keymaps

All Python functionality is accessible through leader key mappings:

- `<leader>pys` - Security scan
- `<leader>pym` - Memory profile
- `<leader>pyP` - CPU profile
- `<leader>pyv` - Create virtual env
- `<leader>pyr` - Generate requirements
- `<leader>pyi` - Install requirements
- `<leader>pya` - Audit dependencies
- `<leader>pyd` - Show dependencies

- `<leader>t` - Test group
- `<leader>tf` - Run file tests
- `<leader>tt` - Run nearest test
- `<leader>to` - Show test output
- `<leader>ts` - Toggle test summary
- `<leader>tc` - Debug nearest test

- `<leader>s` - Software Engineering group
- `<leader>se` - Python subgroup
- `<leader>sec` - Coverage
- `<leader>ser` - Reformat
- `<leader>set` - Test
- `<leader>sel` - Lint
- `<leader>ses` - Security scan

- `<leader>d` - Debug group
- `<leader>db` - Toggle breakpoint
- `<leader>dc` - Continue
- `<leader>do` - Step over
- `<leader>di` - Step into
- `<leader>dO` - Step out
- And more debugging commands

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. Jupyter notebook support
2. More detailed type stubs for popular libraries
3. Integration with Python language server protocol (Pylsp) as an alternative
4. Enhanced data science workflow tools
